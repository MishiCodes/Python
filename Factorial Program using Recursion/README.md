#### __Explanation of methods used for solution__

#### [FACTORIAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
> _The factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n_
> _For example: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120_

#### [RECURSIVE FUNCTION](https://www.python-course.eu/recursive_functions.php)
> _A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and 
repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result._
