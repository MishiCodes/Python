#### Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.
#### You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
#### The array will always contain letters in only one case.

###### Example:

['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e' 
['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'
["a","b","c","d","f"] -> "e"
["O","Q","R","S"] -> "P"
(Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)
