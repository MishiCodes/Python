### An ICA supermarket attendant works every day selling to customers. They have a business where each item you buy, mjolk, 
Pannkakor, Bröd, Paj, and everything there costs a positive number of Kroner (integers). If bröd costs 22 kroner. There is no 
item in ICA that costs a decimal value like 10.13 kr (VAT tax is included in the amount already).
Kroner change can be provide in 1 kr, 2kr, 5kr and 10kr.
Write a function in Python that takes in two arguments will return the correct change to the customer with the smallest possible number of coins (or bills if paper money is used).
