#### Can you find the needle in the haystack? Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle". After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle

###### For example:
find_needle(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'hay', 'moreJunk', 'needle', 'randomJunk'])
###### should return 
"found the needle at position 5"
